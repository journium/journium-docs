];
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Core Metrics

Focus on the metrics that matter most to your business:

```javascript
// Essential metrics to track first
const coreMetrics = [
  "conversion_rate",
  "average_session_duration", 
  "bounce_rate",
  "goal_completions",
  "revenue_per_visitor"
];
```

### 2. Set Up Meaningful Goals

Define goals that align with your business objectives:

```javascript
// ✅ Good goals - specific and measurable
"email_signup_completed"
"free_trial_started"
"purchase_completed"
"support_ticket_resolved"

// ❌ Avoid vague goals
"user_engaged"
"good_experience"
"positive_interaction"
```

### 3. Use Segmentation

Analyze different user groups to understand behavior patterns:

- Segment by traffic source (organic, paid, social)
- Segment by device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Segment by user lifecycle stage (new, returning, churned)
- Segment by geographic location

### 4. Regular Review Schedule

Establish a routine for reviewing your analytics:

- **Daily**: Check real-time metrics and alerts
- **Weekly**: Review conversion performance and trends
- **Monthly**: Deep dive into user behavior and segments
- **Quarterly**: Strategic analysis and goal setting

### 5. Act on Insights

Use your analytics data to make informed decisions:

```javascript
// Example insight-to-action workflow
const insights = [
  {
    insight: "Mobile bounce rate 40% higher than desktop",
    action: "Optimize mobile page speed and design",
    expected_outcome: "15-20% reduction in mobile bounce rate"
  },
  {
    insight: "Users from social media have low conversion rate",
    action: "Create dedicated landing pages for social traffic",
    expected_outcome: "25% increase in social media conversions"
  }
];
```
