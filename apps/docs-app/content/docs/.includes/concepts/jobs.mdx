## What are Jobs?

Jobs are the automated processes that execute Insight Trackers. When a tracker runs—either 
manually triggered or automatically scheduled—it creates a job that carries out the entire 
analysis workflow. Jobs handle the heavy lifting of:

- Collecting relevant event data from your application
- Reviewing execution history to understand context
- Picking up and filtering relevant events based on the tracker configuration
- Executing the tracker's instructions step by step
- Generating insights when adequate data is available

Think of a Job as a single execution of your Insight Tracker's analysis pipeline. Each job 
represents one attempt to analyze your data and generate insights.

## How Jobs Work

Jobs execute the Insight Tracker workflow in a series of steps:

1. **Configuration Loading**: The job picks up the configuration from its associated tracker, 
   including event filters, instructions, and execution parameters

2. **Data Collection**: The job collects relevant events from your application based on the 
   tracker's event selection criteria

3. **Execution History Review**: The job examines previous execution history to understand 
   context and avoid redundant analysis

4. **Event Processing**: Relevant events are filtered and prepared for analysis according to 
   the tracker's configuration

5. **Instruction Execution**: The tracker's instructions are executed step by step, analyzing 
   the collected data

6. **Insight Generation**: If adequate data is available, insights are generated and stored. 
   If insufficient data exists, the job completes as a no-op without generating insights

## Job Execution Modes

Jobs can be triggered in two ways:

### Manual Execution

Jobs can be manually triggered for any tracker from the dashboard. This is useful for:
- Testing tracker configurations during development
- Running ad-hoc analysis on demand
- Troubleshooting tracker behavior
- Validating tracker setup before enabling scheduled execution

To manually trigger a job, navigate to 
[Developers | Insight Trackers](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/insight-trackers) 
and click the **`Analyze now`** button for the desired tracker.

### Automatic Execution

When a tracker is configured with **Scheduled** trigger mode, jobs are automatically created 
and executed according to the defined schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, hourly). This enables 
continuous monitoring and proactive insight generation without manual intervention.

## Viewing Jobs

You can view all jobs for your application instance at 
[Developers | Jobs](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/jobs).

### Jobs List

The jobs list provides an overview of all job executions, showing:

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of jobs listing page from Journium dashboard */}
<ThemedImage 
  srcLight="/images/jobs_list_light.png" 
  srcDark="/images/jobs_list_dark.png" 
  alt="Jobs List" 
  width={1000} 
  height={1000} 
  className="rounded-2xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800"
/>

- **Job Status**: Whether the job is pending, running, completed, or failed
- **Tracker**: The Insight Tracker that triggered the job
- **Execution Time**: When the job was created and executed
- **Duration**: How long the job took to complete
- **Result**: Whether insights were generated or if it was a no-op

### Job Details

Clicking on a specific job opens the job details page, which provides comprehensive information 
about the execution:

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of job details page from Journium dashboard */}
<ThemedImage 
  srcLight="/images/job_details_light.png" 
  srcDark="/images/job_details_dark.png" 
  alt="Job Details" 
  width={1000} 
  height={1000} 
/>

The job details page shows:

- **Execution Steps**: A breakdown of each step in the workflow execution
- **Data Collected**: Information about the events and data processed during execution
- **Job Output**: Detailed logs and output from each step of the execution
- **Generated Insights**: Any insights that were created as a result of this job
- **Error Information**: If the job failed, details about what went wrong

## Monitoring Job Execution

Monitoring job output is particularly helpful during the process of developing trackers. 
The detailed execution logs help you:

- **Troubleshoot Issues**: Identify where in the workflow a problem occurred
- **Validate Configuration**: Verify that your tracker is collecting and processing the expected data
- **Optimize Performance**: Understand which steps take the most time
- **Debug Logic**: See exactly how your tracker's instructions are being executed

By reviewing job details, you can iteratively refine your tracker configuration to ensure 
it's working as expected and generating meaningful insights.

## Job States

Jobs progress through several states during execution:

- **Pending**: The job has been created and is waiting to start execution
- **Running**: The job is currently executing the tracker workflow
- **Completed**: The job finished successfully (may or may not have generated insights)
- **Failed**: The job encountered an error during execution
- **No-op**: The job completed but didn't generate insights due to insufficient data

## No-op Jobs

A job results in a no-op when there isn't adequate data available to execute the tracker's 
instructions meaningfully. This is a normal occurrence and doesn't indicate an error. 
Common reasons for no-op jobs include:

- Not enough events matching the tracker's event filters
- Insufficient data in the specified time window
- Events don't contain the necessary data points for analysis

No-op jobs are still valuable as they confirm your tracker is running correctly, even when 
there isn't enough data to generate insights yet.

## Best Practices

When working with Jobs:

1. **Monitor During Development**: Regularly check job details when developing new trackers 
   to ensure they're working as expected

2. **Review Execution Logs**: Use job output to understand how your tracker processes data 
   and identify potential improvements

3. **Check Job History**: Review past job executions to understand patterns in data availability 
   and insight generation

4. **Use Manual Execution for Testing**: Trigger jobs manually when testing tracker 
   configurations before enabling scheduled execution

5. **Understand No-ops**: Don't be concerned about no-op jobs—they're normal when data is 
   insufficient and indicate your tracker is running correctly

**Job Monitoring**: The job details page provides real-time updates during execution, 
making it easy to monitor long-running jobs and troubleshoot issues as they occur.
