A Job in Journium is an execution instance of an [Insight Tracker](/docs/concepts/insight_trackers). 
Jobs are responsible for collecting data, analyzing events, and generating insights based on the 
tracker's configuration. Each job execution represents a single run of the tracker's workflow, 
from data collection to insight generation.
