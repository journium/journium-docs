## What is an Event?

An event in Journium is a single piece of telemetry data. Its the primary primitive that 
drives all the analytics and insights. When you use the Journium SDK, you are essentially sending events to Journium.
Some events are auto-captured by the SDK, such as page views, clicks, form submissions, and errors, but you can control
what you send to Journium.

## Event Structure

An event in Journium has the following structure:

```typescript
{
  event: string;
  properties: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

- `event`: The name of the event.
- `properties`: A record of key-value pairs that you can use to add additional context to the event.

## Event Types

There are two main types of events in Journium:

- Custom Events
- Auto-captured Events


### Custom Events

Custom Events are events that you manually send to Journium. 
You can send any event you want to Journium, and you can add any properties you want to the event.

```tsx title="app/your-path/page.tsx"
import { useTrackEvent } from '@journium/nextjs';

function ProductPage() {
  const trackEvent = useTrackEvent();

  const handlePurchase = () => {
    trackEvent('purchase_started', {
      product_id: 'prod_123',
      page: 'product_detail',
      value: 29.99
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Buy Now</button>;
}
```

### Auto-captured Events

Auto-captured Events are events that are automatically captured by the SDK. They can be enabled 
or disabled by configuring the SDK. See 
[Advanced Configuration](/docs/(nextjs)/concepts/advanced-configuration) for more details.

**Configuration Precedence** When you configure at the SDK level, it overrides the configuration in the Journium dashboard.
The final derived configuration is the combination of the configuration in the Journium dashboard and the configuration in the SDK
with the SDK configuration taking precedence.
