Journium works by collecting [Events](/docs/concepts/events) from your application and then using AI to generate insights 
from those events. Users integrate the Journium SDK into their applications, which sends events 
to Journium's API where they are ingested and processed. Users then create [Insight Trackers](/docs/concepts/insight-trackers) that define 
the mechanics around how [Insights](/docs/concepts/insights) should be generated, and [Jobs](/docs/concepts/jobs) 
execute those trackers to produce insights. These insights are then available on the Journium dashboard for users to view and analyze.

## Journium Workflow

### Event Collection

Event collection is the foundation of Journium's analytics pipeline. Users integrate 
the Journium SDK into their applications, which acts as a lightweight client library 
that captures user interactions and application events. When events occur in your 
application—such as user signups, purchases, feature usage, or errors—the SDK automatically 
sends these events to Journium's API endpoint. The API receives and ingests these events, 
storing them in a time-series database optimized for analytics queries. This continuous 
stream of event data provides the raw material that powers all subsequent analysis 
and insight generation.

### Tracker Definition

Trackers are declarative configurations that define what should be analyzed and how insights 
should be generated. Users create trackers through the Journium dashboard, specifying 
which events to monitor (or analyzing all events), setting custom instructions for 
the AI analysis, and configuring execution schedules. Each tracker acts like a continuous 
data analyst that monitors specific patterns in your event data. Trackers can be set to 
run automatically on a schedule (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) or triggered manually 
for ad-hoc analysis. The tracker configuration includes parameters such as the maximum number 
of events to analyze, custom AI instructions that guide the analysis focus, and the 
specific event types to consider. This "Insights as Code" approach allows users to define 
what they want to know about their application without writing SQL queries or building dashboards.

### Job Execution

Job execution is the automated process that runs trackers and generates insights. When a tracker 
is scheduled to run or manually triggered, Journium creates a job that executes the tracker's 
analysis workflow. The job execution follows a multi-step pipeline: it first validates the 
tracker configuration and checks data availability, then queries the event database to 
retrieve the relevant events based on the tracker's configuration. The job then uses AI 
to analyze the event data, looking for patterns, trends, anomalies, and correlations. The 
AI engine processes the data according to the tracker's instructions, synthesizing findings 
into concise, natural language insights that are typically 1-3 sentences long and backed 
by verifiable data. Finally, the job stores the generated insights and updates the execution 
history, making them ready for display in the dashboard.

### Insights Display

Once insights are generated by job execution, they become available in the Journium dashboard 
for users to view and analyze. Insights are displayed in a feed format on the application instance's 
insights page, similar to a social media feed, where each insight appears as a card showing the 
analysis results, timestamp, and metadata. Users can interact with insights by liking them, adding 
comments for team collaboration, saving them for later reference, or sharing them with team members. 
The dashboard also provides features like pagination to browse through historical insights, 
filtering options, and the ability to see insight trends over time. This presentation format makes 
insights easily scannable and actionable, transforming raw event data into understandable narratives 
that help teams make data-driven decisions about their application.
