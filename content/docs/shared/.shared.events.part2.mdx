**Configuration Precedence** When you configure at the SDK level, it overrides the configuration in the Journium dashboard.
The final derived configuration is the combination of the configuration in the Journium dashboard and the configuration in the SDK
with the SDK configuration taking precedence.

## Viewing Events

You can view events in the Journium dashboard. 
You can list them at [Developers | Events](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/events) 
from your application instance page.

## Event Simulator

In your Development instance, you can test your event tracking by using the Event Simulator.
It enables you to impersonate your app temporarily and send events on behalf of your app. 
This isuseful when you have not yet added custom eventsin your app via the SDK and want to test tracker execution based on events

You can access it at [Developers | Event Simulation](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/simulation).
