We're excited to announce that **Journium is now generally available**.

After months of working closely with teams during private preview, we're opening access to everyone. Journium transforms how product teams understand user behavior—moving from reactive dashboard hunting to proactive, continuous intelligence delivered automatically.

For a limited time, we're offering **free access to early adopters** who want to experience analytics that work like the rest of their modern stack: declarative, version-controlled, and automated.

## The Problem with Traditional Analytics

Modern applications generate vast amounts of telemetry. Yet despite this abundance, most teams still discover critical insights too late—or not at all.

The traditional model is broken:

**Telemetry → Storage → Queries → Dashboards → Hope**

Teams instrument events, build data warehouses, create dashboards, and then hope someone notices when something important changes. This approach demands constant manual exploration, requires deep domain expertise to interpret correctly, and operates reactively—by the time you spot a pattern, the moment to act may have already passed.

The result? Organizations drowning in data but starving for insight.

## Analytics That Speak First

Journium inverts this model entirely.

Instead of waiting for humans to ask the right questions, Journium continuously monitors your application's behavioral patterns, detects meaningful changes automatically, performs root-cause analysis on shifts in user behavior, and delivers concise, narrative insights in plain language.

**Telemetry → Meaning → Action**

Think of it as an analytics system that acts like a data analyst working 24/7—one that tells you *"users from enterprise segment are abandoning onboarding at step 3 due to integration complexity, down 23% this week"* instead of showing you a chart and hoping you notice.

## Insights as Code: The Foundation

At the core of Journium is **Insights as Code**—a paradigm shift that treats product intelligence as first-class, version-controlled artifacts.

Just as Infrastructure as Code transformed how we manage servers, Insights as Code transforms how we manage product understanding:

- **Define what matters declaratively** using simple YAML specifications
- **Version control your insights** alongside your application code
- **Deploy intelligence continuously** as part of your standard workflow
- **Trust automated analysis** backed by transparent data and reproducible logic

Your insights live in your repository. They're reviewed in pull requests. They deploy with your application. They run continuously.

No more context-switching to dashboard tools. No more wondering what changed while you weren't looking.

## What Early Teams Are Seeing

During private preview, we worked closely with product teams across SaaS, e-commerce, and developer tools. Here's what we learned:

**Faster time to insight.** Teams report discovering critical behavioral shifts days or weeks earlier than they would have with traditional dashboards—often before the impact becomes visible in high-level metrics.

**Reduced analytics overhead.** Engineering and product teams spend less time building and maintaining data pipelines, modeling warehouses, and interpreting charts. Journium handles continuous evaluation automatically.

**Better decision velocity.** When insights arrive proactively with clear explanations, teams can act immediately instead of scheduling analysis sessions to understand what dashboards are showing.

One early adopter described it as "analytics that respect my attention instead of demanding it."

## How Journium Works

Getting started is straightforward:

1. **Integrate the SDK** into your application (React, Next.js, or vanilla JavaScript)
2. **Define insight trackers** in YAML that specify what behavioral patterns matter
3. **Receive insights automatically** as your users interact with your product

Journium handles the rest: continuous monitoring across all user journeys, AI-powered pattern detection and analysis, automatic insight generation when behavior shifts, and delivery directly to Slack, email, or your dashboard.

The barrier to trying a new analysis becomes remarkably low—just define a new tracker and let the system watch continuously.

## Built for Modern Development Teams

Journium is designed for teams that already treat infrastructure, testing, and observability as code. Now you can apply the same engineering rigor to product analytics:

- **Developer-first integration** with first-class TypeScript support
- **Declarative configuration** that lives in your repository
- **CI/CD-friendly** deployment alongside your application
- **Transparent and verifiable** insights backed by data and code

This isn't analytics bolted onto your workflow. It's analytics that works like the rest of your stack.

## Pricing and Early Access

Journium is generally available today. For a limited time, we're offering **free access to early adopters** who sign up now.

This is your opportunity to experience analytics that shift left—bringing product intelligence into developer workflows where it can drive decisions at the speed of development, not the speed of dashboard queries.

As we scale, pricing will reflect usage. Early adopters lock in current access terms.

## What's Next

General availability is just the beginning. We're actively building:

- **Deeper integrations** with popular data warehouses and analytics tools
- **Enhanced collaboration features** for teams managing insights at scale
- **Expanded AI capabilities** for more sophisticated behavioral analysis
- **Real-time alerting** for critical pattern changes that demand immediate attention

We're committed to transforming product analytics from a passive reporting system into an active intelligence layer that helps teams learn faster and build better products.

## Join Us

The future of product analytics isn't more dashboards. It's fewer questions left unanswered, discovered early enough to act.

If you're building products and believe that analytics should work like the rest of your modern stack—declarative, automated, and proactive—we built Journium for you.
