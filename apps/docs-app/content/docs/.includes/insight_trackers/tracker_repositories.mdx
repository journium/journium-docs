## Tracker location

As a best practice, it is recommended to use a Git repository to store your trackers. You can connect a repository to your application instance
to deploy and manage your trackers.
When you push your changes to the deployment branch, the trackers will be synced to your application instance.
You can select any branch as the deployment branch. By default, the deployment branch is the default branch of the repository.


<Callout type="info" title="Good to know">
<span className="leading-6">
  Your tracker yaml files should be in the `.journium/trackers` directory in your repository. 
  For example, if your repository is `https://github.com/my-org/my-repo`, your tracker yaml 
  files should be in the `https://github.com/my-org/my-repo/.journium/trackers` directory.
  </span>
</Callout>

### Recommended Layout

You can colocate your trackers in your source code repository (recommended) or in a seperate repository as well. 
Here's how your repository should look like for the best practice:

<Files>
  <Folder name="repository root" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name=".journium" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="trackers" defaultOpen>
        <File name="user-signup.yaml" />
        <File name="api-requests.yaml" />
        <File name="page-views.yaml" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="src" defaultOpen={false}>
      <File name="index.js" />
      <Folder name="utils" defaultOpen>
        <File name="helper.js" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <File name="package.json" />
  </Folder>
</Files>


## Linking a Git Repository

Follw the steps below to to link a git repository containing tracker yaml files to your application instance.

### Connect Git Account

To link a repository, you need to have a Git integration configured in Journium. You can configure a Git integration at 
[Integrations | Git](https://dashboard.journium.app/integrations/git) by connecting your GitHub account. For other 
Git providers, drop us a note at [support@journium.app](mailto:support@journium.app).

The GitHub App for Journium is used to connect your GitHub repositories to your application instance. 
You can provide permissions to the specific repositories you want to connect to your application instance.

### Link Repository

After you have configured a Git integration, you can link a repository to your application instance.

/>

### View Deployment History

Navigate to the Tracker Repositories page to view the deployment history of your trackers. When you push changes to
the deployment branch, the trackers will be synced to your application instance. This is called a deployment. Files are
deployed to the application instance only if the YAML is valid.
