Clerk offers a comprehensive suite of hooks that expose low-level access to authentication, 
session management, and multi-tenancy. With Clerk hooks, you can access and manage user data, 
handle sign-in and sign-up flows, control session management, and implement advanced flows 
like session reverification for sensitive actions. By using these hooks, you can extend or 
replace Clerk's built-in components and customize how authentication behaves in your application.
