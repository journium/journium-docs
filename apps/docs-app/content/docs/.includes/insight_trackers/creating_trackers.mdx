Trackers can be created in two ways. For creating one quickly, you can use the UI based wizard. 
For more control, you can create them manually using the tracker specification YAML, and version control them in a Git repository.
Irrespective of the method you use, you can always edit the tracker specification YAML to change the tracker configuration. 

Trackers are specific to an application instance. Trackers configured for an application instance are not shared with other application instances.

## UI Based Wizard

You can create a new tracker using the UI based wizard. This will guide you through the process of creating a new tracker.

You can create a new tracker for your application instance at 
[Developers | Insight Trackers | Create New](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/insight-trackers/new).
Choose the **UI Based Wizard** option to create a new tracker using the UI wizard.

  alt="Tracker Creation Using UI" 
  width={1000} 
  height={1000} 
/>

Each tracker is configured using the UI wizard as follows:

### Status

Tracker Status can be **Draft** or **Active**. Flip the toggle switch to change the status. 
Scheduled execution won't be done on Draft trackers, but you can manually trigger an analysis.

  srcDark="/images/tracker_status_dark.png" 
  alt="Tracker Status" 
  width={1000} 
  height={1000} 
/>

### Basic Info

This section captures the **Name** and **Description** of the tracker. 
The name should be descriptive and identify what the tracker monitors 
(e.g., "User Engagement Tracker", "Purchase Funnel Analysis", "Error Rate Monitor"). 
The description provides a clear explanation of what the tracker analyzes and what 
insights you're looking for, helping the AI understand the context and focus of the analysis.

  alt="Tracker Basic Info"

  height={1000} 
/>

### Configuration

This section captures **Max Events**, **Instruction**, and **Trigger Mode**. 

- **Max Events**: Set the maximum number of events to analyze
- **Instruction**: Provide specific instructions to guide the AI analysis
- **Trigger Mode**: Select from the dropdown - either **Manual** or **Scheduled**
  - **Manual**: The tracker runs only when you explicitly trigger it from the dashboard. Useful for ad-hoc analysis or testing.
  - **Scheduled**: The tracker runs automatically on a schedule. If scheduled, specify 
    the schedule (e.g., `daily`, `weekly`, `hourly`). Ideal for continuous monitoring and proactive insight generation.

/>

### Events

Either select all events using the toggle switch, or specify individual events to consider. 
When selecting specific events, choose the event types you want the tracker to analyze 
(e.g., only `purchase_started` and `purchase_completed`). The tracker will only analyze the 
events you specify, allowing you to create focused trackers for different aspects of your application.

### Best Practices

When creating Insight Trackers:

1. **Be Specific**: Focus each tracker on a particular question or area of interest rather than trying to analyze everything at once
2. **Choose Relevant Events**: Select events that are meaningful for the insight you're seeking
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name trackers clearly so team members understand what they monitor
4. **Set Appropriate Schedules**: Use scheduled execution for trackers that need continuous monitoring, and manual execution for exploratory analysis
5. **Iterate**: Start with broad trackers and refine them based on the insights you receive

<Callout>
**Default Tracker**: When you create an app in Journium, a default "User Engagement" tracker is automatically created. This tracker helps you test data ingestion and insight generation with your initial events.

## Using YAML Editor

You can create a new tracker manually using the tracker specification YAML. This will give you more control over the tracker creation process.

You can create a new tracker for your application instance at 
[Developers | Insight Trackers | Create New](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/insight-trackers/new).
Choose the **Use YAML Editor** option to create a new tracker manually using the tracker specification YAML.

<ThemedImage

  srcDark="/images/tracker_creation_using_yaml_editor_dark.png" 
  alt="Tracker Creation Using YAML Editor" 
  width={1000} 
  height={1000} 
/>

The YAML editor is pre-filled with a sample tracker specification. You can edit the YAML to change the tracker configuration.

  width={1000} 
  height={1000} 
/>

## Version Control

You can version control your trackers in a Git repository. This will allow you to deploy and manage your trackers.

You can connect a repository to your application instance at 
[Developers | Insight Trackers | Connect Repository](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/insight-trackers/connect-repository).
Choose the repository you want to connect to your application instance.
