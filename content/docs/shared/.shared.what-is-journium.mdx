**Journium** is an awareness layer for modern applications. Instead of asking humans to hunt 
through dashboards, Journium sits on top of your telemetry and automatically detects meaningful 
behavioral change, explains what happened, and surfaces insights proactively — in plain language.

**Data exists. Awareness doesn't.** Journium flips that model.


## Core Philosophy

Journium follows a simple principle:

**Telemetry → Meaning → Action**

Not: Telemetry → Storage → Queries → Dashboards → Hope

Your application doesn't need more dashboards. It needs a way to speak up when something meaningful changes.
