**Journium is now generally available.**

After months of private preview with product teams across SaaS, e-commerce, and developer tools, we're opening access to everyone. For early adopters who sign up now, we're offering free access to the platform.

## The problem with traditional analytics

It's Tuesday morning. Your conversion rate dropped 15% yesterday, but nobody noticed until the weekly business review. By the time you investigate, you discover that enterprise users have been abandoning your onboarding flow at step three for the past week. The change coincided with a seemingly unrelated backend update that increased API latency by 200ms—just enough to make the integration step feel broken.

You have the data. You have the dashboards. But you only found out after a week of lost conversions.

This pattern repeats across product teams: instrument events, build warehouses, create dashboards, then hope someone notices when something changes. Manual exploration demands constant vigilance. Interpretation requires deep domain expertise. By the time you spot the pattern, you've already lost the window to act decisively.

Modern applications generate vast amounts of telemetry, yet most teams discover critical insights too late—or not at all.

## Analytics that speak first

Journium inverts this model. Instead of waiting for you to ask the right questions, it continuously monitors behavioral patterns and tells you what changed—before you look for it.

When enterprise users start abandoning onboarding at step three, Journium detects the shift, correlates it with segment characteristics and timing, performs root-cause analysis, and delivers a plain-language insight: "Enterprise segment abandoning onboarding at step 3 due to integration complexity, down 23% since Monday's deployment."

Not a chart. Not a dashboard alert. A complete analysis that arrives while you can still act on it.

This is the shift from reactive dashboards to proactive intelligence. Your analytics system works like a data analyst who never sleeps—one that understands context, spots anomalies, and explains what matters in terms you can act on immediately.

## Insights as Code: The foundation

At Journium's core is **Insights as Code**—treating product intelligence as version-controlled artifacts that live in your repository.

Define what matters using YAML specifications. Your insights deploy with your application. They run continuously. Changes go through pull request reviews. You get the same reproducibility and transparency for analytics that Infrastructure as Code brought to operations.

Here's what a tracker looks like:

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/onboarding-completion.yml"
apiVersion: journium.app/v0Alpha
kind: InsightTracker
metadata:
  name: onboarding-completion
  displayName: Onboarding Completion Analysis
spec:
  description: Track completion rates across onboarding steps
  schedule: daily
  trackingGoal: >
    Analyze user progression through onboarding steps.
    Identify drop-off points and segment-specific patterns.
    Flag significant changes in completion rates.
```

That's it. Commit this file, deploy your application, and Journium continuously monitors the pattern you defined. When behavior shifts, you get an insight explaining what changed and why.

No context-switching to dashboard tools. No manual queries to check status. The tracker runs automatically, and insights arrive when they matter.

## What early teams discovered

During private preview, we saw consistent patterns emerge:

**Time to insight dropped dramatically.** Teams discovered behavioral shifts days or weeks earlier than they would have with dashboard-driven workflows. Often before the impact became visible in aggregate metrics. One team caught a payment flow regression within hours of deployment—their dashboard would have shown it the next day, after hundreds of failed transactions.

**Analytics overhead decreased.** Engineering teams spent less time building data pipelines and modeling warehouses. Product teams spent less time interpreting charts and scheduling analysis sessions. Journium handles continuous evaluation automatically. The barrier to trying a new analysis becomes remarkably low—just define a tracker and let the system watch.

**Decision velocity improved.** When insights arrive proactively with clear explanations, teams act immediately instead of waiting for the next analytics review. One early adopter described it as "analytics that respect my attention instead of demanding it."

The shift isn't just operational—it's cultural. Analytics becomes something your codebase does, not something you context-switch to a different tool to check.

## How it works

Getting started takes three steps:

**Integrate the SDK.** Add Journium to your React, Next.js, or vanilla JavaScript application. The SDK captures user interactions and sends behavioral data to the Journium platform.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @journium/sdk
```

```typescript title="app/layout.tsx"
import { JourniumProvider } from '@journium/sdk';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <JourniumProvider apiKey={process.env.JOURNIUM_API_KEY}>
      {children}
    </JourniumProvider>
  );
}
```

**Define insight trackers.** Create YAML files that specify what behavioral patterns matter to your product. Trackers live in your repository alongside your application code.

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/feature-adoption.yml"
apiVersion: journium.app/v0Alpha
kind: InsightTracker
metadata:
  name: feature-adoption
  displayName: Feature Adoption Tracker
spec:
  description: Monitor adoption of new features across user segments
  schedule: daily
  trackingGoal: >
    Track feature usage by segment and cohort.
    Identify adoption patterns and barriers.
    Flag unexpected changes in engagement.
```

**Receive insights automatically.** As users interact with your product, Journium evaluates your trackers continuously. When behavior shifts meaningfully, you get insights delivered to Slack, email, or your Journium dashboard—complete with analysis explaining what changed, why it matters, and which segments are affected.

## Built for modern development teams

Journium is designed for teams that already treat infrastructure, testing, and observability as code. The same engineering rigor now applies to product analytics.

Developer-first integration with TypeScript support means no fighting with configuration or deployment. Declarative specifications that live in your repository ensure reproducibility and transparency. CI/CD-friendly deployment alongside your application eliminates separate analytics infrastructure. Every insight is backed by verifiable data and traceable logic—no black boxes.

This isn't analytics bolted onto your workflow. It works like the rest of your stack: declarative, version-controlled, automated.

## Pricing and early access

Journium is generally available today with free access for early adopters who sign up now. This is your opportunity to experience analytics that shift left—bringing product intelligence into developer workflows where decisions happen at the speed of deployment, not dashboard queries.

As we scale, pricing will reflect usage. Early adopters lock in current access terms.

## What's next

General availability is the beginning. We're building deeper integrations with data warehouses and analytics platforms, enhanced collaboration features for teams managing insights at scale, expanded AI capabilities for more sophisticated behavioral analysis, and real-time alerting for critical pattern changes that demand immediate attention.

The goal is consistent: transform product analytics from a passive reporting system into an active intelligence layer that helps teams learn faster and build better products.

## Join us

The future of product analytics isn't more dashboards. It's intelligence that arrives before you go looking for it.

If you're building products and believe that analytics should work like the rest of your modern stack—declarative, automated, and proactive—Journium was built for you.
