The Journium VS Code extension provides real-time validation, auto-completion, and tooling for insight tracker files. Works with VS Code and VS Code-compatible editors like Cursor.

## Installation

### Recommended: Install from Your IDE

The quickest way to install is directly from your editor's Extensions view:

1. Open your editor (VS Code, Cursor, or other compatible IDE)
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Journium"
4. Click Install

### Alternative: Direct Download

You can also install directly from these registries:

- **VS Code users**: [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Journium.journium)
- **Cursor and other editors**: [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Journium/journium)

Many VS Code-compatible editors like Cursor use the Open VSX Registry as their extension source.

## Features

### Automatic Activation

The extension activates automatically when it detects tracker files in `.journium/trackers/` within your workspace. No manual configuration required.

### Real-time Schema Validation

Get instant feedback as you write tracker YAML files. The extension validates all files under `.journium/trackers/` against the Journium insight tracker schema, catching errors before deployment.

### IntelliSense Support

Benefit from auto-completion, hover documentation, and inline schema hints while editing tracker files. Write trackers faster with contextual suggestions.

### Monorepo Ready

Works seamlessly with monorepos and nested folder structures. The extension detects tracker files at any depth within your workspace.

## Getting Started

Once installed, the extension works automatically:

1. Create or open a workspace containing a `.journium/trackers/` folder
2. Add YAML files to define your trackers
3. Start editing—validation and IntelliSense activate automatically

The extension activates when it detects files matching `**/.journium/trackers/**/*.yml` or `**/.journium/trackers/**/*.yaml`.

## How It Works

The extension configures the [Red Hat YAML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) to validate tracker files using the Journium schema. When activated, it adds this configuration to your workspace settings:

```json
{
  "yaml.schemas": {
    "https://journium.app/schemas/journium-insight-tracker.schema.json": [
      "**/.journium/trackers/**/*.yml",
      "**/.journium/trackers/**/*.yaml"
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration:
- Only affects files under `.journium/trackers/`—other YAML files remain unchanged
- Persists across sessions
- Can be committed to version control to share with your team

## Manual Configuration

If you need to manually trigger configuration, use the Command Palette:

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run: **Journium: Enable schema validation for this workspace**

This is useful for setting up validation before creating tracker files.

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.105.0 or higher (or compatible editor like Cursor)
- Red Hat YAML extension (installed automatically as a dependency)

## Privacy & Performance

**Local validation**: All schema validation happens within your editor—no data is sent to external servers.

**Zero overhead**: The extension uses VS Code's built-in file index to detect tracker folders without additional file system scans.

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Not Working

If validation isn't working:

1. Verify your tracker files are under `.journium/trackers/`
2. Check that files have `.yml` or `.yaml` extensions
3. Run the manual configuration command from the Command Palette
4. Reload the window (`Developer: Reload Window`)

### Removing Validation

To remove schema validation from your workspace:

1. Open `.vscode/settings.json` in your workspace
2. Remove the `yaml.schemas` entry for `journium-insight-tracker.schema.json`
3. Save the file
