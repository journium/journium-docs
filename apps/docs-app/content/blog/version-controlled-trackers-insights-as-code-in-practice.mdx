We're excited to announce full support for **version-controlled insight trackers** in Journium. You can now define, review, and deploy your product intelligence exactly like you ship code—in Git, through pull requests, with automatic deployments.

This isn't a convenience feature. It's the complete implementation of Insights as Code.

## The Problem: Analytics Configuration Trapped in UIs

Most analytics tools force you to configure everything through dashboards. Click through forms. Configure dropdowns. Hope you remember what you changed last week.

This creates real problems:

- **No change history**: Who modified this tracker? What was it before? Why did it change?
- **No review process**: Changes go live immediately without peer review or validation
- **No rollback**: If something breaks, good luck reconstructing what worked before
- **Context switching**: Leave your IDE, open a browser, navigate through menus, repeat
- **Team friction**: Changes to analytics logic don't follow the same workflow as code changes

For teams treating infrastructure, testing, and observability as code, this workflow feels broken.

## The Solution: Trackers as YAML in Git

With Journium's tracker repositories, your insight definitions live where they belong—in your codebase:

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/onboarding-dropoff.yml"
apiVersion: journium.app/v0Alpha
kind: InsightTracker
metadata:
  name: onboarding-dropoff
  displayName: Onboarding Completion Analysis
  description: Track users who start but don't complete onboarding
spec:
  type: LLM
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    schedule: daily
  llmPrompt: |
    Analyze onboarding behavior and identify:
    - Drop-off patterns by step
    - Common characteristics of users who abandon
    - Time-based trends (weekday vs weekend, time of day)
    - Correlations with account type or traffic source
  data:
    events:
      - onboarding_started
      - profile_completed
      - team_invited
      - onboarding_completed
    maxEvents: 500
```

This tracker specification is now a **first-class artifact** in your repository. It gets reviewed, versioned, and deployed just like application code.

## How It Works

<section id="how-it-works-section">
<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Connect Your Repository

Link any GitHub repository to your Journium application instance. You control which repositories have access—Journium only sees what you explicitly authorize.

The setup takes less than two minutes:

1. Install the Journium GitHub App
2. Grant repository access
3. Choose your deployment branch (usually `main` or `production`)
4. Done

### Organize Your Trackers

Place tracker YAML files in `.journium/trackers/` anywhere in your repository:

```bash
my-app/
├── .journium/
│   └── trackers/
│       ├── onboarding-dropoff.yml
│       ├── purchase-funnel.yml
│       └── feature-adoption.yml
├── src/
│   └── ... your application code
└── package.json
```

You can colocate trackers with your application code (recommended) or maintain them in a separate repository. Both approaches work—choose what fits your team's workflow.

**Monorepo-friendly**: The `.journium/trackers/` convention works at any depth. Place trackers at the root or within individual packages. Journium discovers them automatically.

### Deploy on Push

When you push changes to your deployment branch, Journium automatically syncs your trackers:

- **Validates YAML** against the schema before deployment
- **Shows deployment history** with timestamps and commit references
- **Fails fast** if validation errors exist—broken trackers never deploy

No manual syncing. No dashboard clicks. Push your branch, and your insights deploy.

</div>
</section>

## The Developer Experience

### Real-Time Validation in Your Editor

Install the [Journium VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Journium.journium) to get:

- **Schema validation** as you type
- **Auto-completion** for all tracker properties
- **Inline documentation** on hover
- **Error detection** before you commit

Works in VS Code, Cursor, and any VS Code-compatible editor.

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/example.yml"
spec:
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    schedule: # ← Auto-complete suggests: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or cron
```

### Review Trackers in Pull Requests

Treat analytics changes like code changes:

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/onboarding-dropoff.yml"
spec:
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    // [!code --:1]
    schedule: weekly
    // [!code ++:1]
    schedule: daily
  data:
    // [!code --:1]
    maxEvents: 100
    // [!code ++:1]
    maxEvents: 500
```

Your team reviews the change. Discusses the rationale. Approves or requests modifications. Merges when ready.

**The insight logic is now part of your code review process.**

### Rollback with Git

If an insight tracker causes issues (too noisy, wrong events, unclear prompt), rollback is one command:

```bash title="Terminal"
git revert abc123
git push
```

Your trackers instantly revert to the previous working state. No dashboard archaeology required.

### CI/CD Integration

Validate trackers in CI before they reach production:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/validate-trackers.yml"
name: Validate Trackers

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Validate tracker schemas
        run: |
          npm install -g ajv-cli
          ajv validate \
            -s https://journium.app/schemas/journium-insight-tracker.schema.json \
            -d ".journium/trackers/*.yaml"
```

Broken trackers fail CI. They never merge. Your analytics stay reliable.

## Why This Matters

### 1. Insights Become Reviewable

Analytics logic is no longer hidden in dashboard configuration. It's explicit, readable, and reviewable:

- **What** are we tracking? (Event selection)
- **Why** does it matter? (Tracker description and prompt)
- **When** does it run? (Trigger mode and schedule)
- **How much** data does it analyze? (Event limits)

Teammates review these decisions in pull requests, not after deployment.

### 2. Change History is Preserved

Every modification to your analytics is captured in Git history:

```bash title="Terminal"
git log --oneline .journium/trackers/

a7b3c1d Increase event limit for purchase-funnel tracker
f2e9d8a Add new tracker for feature-adoption analysis
c4b1a6e Update onboarding-dropoff to run daily instead of weekly
```

You have a complete audit trail of who changed what, when, and why.

### 3. Analytics Logic Lives Near Code

When you ship a new feature, the insight tracker that monitors it ships in the same pull request:

```bash
# PR: Add team collaboration feature

src/
# [!code ++:3]
  features/collaboration/
    ├── TeamInvite.tsx
    └── CollaborationProvider.tsx

.journium/trackers/
# [!code ++:1]
  team-collaboration-adoption.yml
```

The behavior tracking ships with the feature. No follow-up tickets. No context loss.

### 4. Deployment is Automatic

No manual dashboard configuration. No "remember to update the tracker after you deploy." Push your branch, and your insights deploy automatically.

**Trackers stay synchronized with your application without manual intervention.**

## Real-World Workflow

Here's how version-controlled trackers fit into a typical development cycle:

### Scenario: Launching a New Onboarding Flow

**1. Feature branch**

```bash title="Terminal"
git checkout -b feature/new-onboarding-flow
```

**2. Implement the feature + tracker together**

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/onboarding-v2-analysis.yml"
apiVersion: journium.app/v0Alpha
kind: InsightTracker
metadata:
  name: onboarding-v2-analysis
  displayName: New Onboarding Flow Performance
  description: Monitor adoption and completion of redesigned onboarding
spec:
  type: LLM
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    schedule: daily
  llmPrompt: |
    Compare new onboarding flow (v2) performance against baseline:
    - Completion rate differences
    - Time to complete
    - Step-level drop-off changes
    - Segment-specific patterns
  data:
    events:
      - onboarding_v2_started
      - onboarding_v2_step_completed
      - onboarding_v2_completed
    maxEvents: 1000
```

**3. Open pull request**

Your team reviews both the feature code and the insight tracker. Someone suggests increasing `maxEvents` to capture more data. You update the YAML. Everyone approves.

**4. Merge to main**

```bash title="Terminal"
git merge feature/new-onboarding-flow
git push origin main
```

**5. Automatic deployment**

- Application code deploys via your existing CI/CD
- Tracker deploys via Journium's automatic sync
- Insights start flowing the next day

**6. Monitor results**

Journium analyzes your new onboarding flow daily and delivers insights automatically. No dashboard hunting. No manual queries.

**7. Iterate based on insights**

If the tracker reveals issues, you adjust the onboarding flow and update the tracker in the same commit. The analytics evolve with the product.

## Advanced Patterns

### Scheduled vs. Manual Trackers

Run some trackers continuously, trigger others on-demand:

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/continuous-monitor.yml"
spec:
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    schedule: hourly
```

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/manual-analysis.yml"
spec:
  trigger:
    mode: manual
```

Manual trackers are useful for exploratory analysis or expensive operations you don't want running continuously.

### Custom Cron Schedules

For precise timing, use cron expressions:

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/weekly-report.yml"
spec:
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    schedule:
      cron: "0 9 * * 1"
```

### Event Filtering Strategies

Focus trackers on specific user journeys:

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/purchase-events.yml"
data:
  events:
    - product_viewed
    - cart_updated
    - checkout_started
    - purchase_completed
  maxEvents: 500
```

```yaml title=".journium/trackers/all-events.yml"
data:
  events: "*"
  maxEvents: 1000
```

### Multi-Environment Deployments

Use separate branches for staging and production trackers:

- **Staging**: Deploy from `develop` branch to test new trackers
- **Production**: Deploy from `main` branch for stable insights

Same workflow as your application deployments.

## Comparison: UI vs. Git-Based Trackers

| Aspect | Dashboard UI | Version-Controlled YAML |
|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Change tracking** | ❌ None | ✅ Full Git history |
| **Peer review** | ❌ Not possible | ✅ Pull request reviews |
| **Rollback** | ❌ Manual recreation | ✅ `git revert` |
| **CI/CD integration** | ❌ N/A | ✅ Validate in pipeline |
| **Colocation with code** | ❌ Separate tool | ✅ Same repository |
| **Team visibility** | ⚠️ Dashboard only | ✅ Git log + PRs |
| **Editor tooling** | ❌ None | ✅ VS Code extension |

Both approaches work with Journium. Choose the UI for quick experiments. Choose Git for production trackers.

apiVersion: journium.app/v0Alpha
kind: InsightTracker
metadata:
  name: my-first-tracker
  displayName: User Engagement Monitor
  description: Track daily active user patterns
spec:
  type: LLM
  trigger:
    mode: automatic
    schedule: daily
  llmPrompt: |
    Analyze user engagement patterns and identify:
    - Daily active user trends
    - Peak usage times
    - Drop-offs or anomalies
  data:
    events: "*"
    maxEvents: 500
```

### Link Your Repository

In the Journium dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Developers → Insight Trackers → Link Git Repository**
2. Install the GitHub App and authorize repository access
3. Select your repository and deployment branch
4. Save

### Push and Deploy

```bash title="Terminal"
git add .journium/trackers/my-first-tracker.yml
git commit -m "Add user engagement tracker"
git push origin main
```

Journium deploys your tracker automatically. Check the deployment history in the dashboard to confirm.


### View Insights

Your tracker runs on its schedule and delivers insights automatically. You can view the insights in the dashboard.

## What's Next

Version-controlled trackers are live today. We're actively expanding this foundation:

- **Enhanced validation** with more detailed error messages in CI
- **Tracker dependencies** to compose complex analyses from simpler building blocks
- **Terraform provider** for managing Journium resources as infrastructure
- **Webhook integrations** to trigger deployments from custom workflows

If you have feedback or feature requests, [reach out](https://journium.app/contact). We're building this with you.

## The Bigger Picture

Version-controlled trackers complete the vision of Insights as Code:

- **Infrastructure as Code** → Manage servers declaratively
- **Policy as Code** → Encode security and compliance rules
- **Observability as Code** → Define SLOs and alerts in Git
- **Insights as Code** → Version-control product intelligence

Your analytics now follow the same rigorous workflow as everything else you build.

The result? **Product intelligence that ships with your product, not weeks after it.**
