An Insight Tracker in Journium is a declarative configuration that tells Journium what to 
analyze and how often. It acts as a bridge between your raw [Events](/docs/concepts/events) 
and the [Insights](/docs/concepts/insights) that help you understand your application's behavior.

## What are Insight Trackers?

Insight Trackers are the core of Journium's **Insights as Code** approach. Instead of manually 
querying data or building dashboards, you define what you want to know about your application, 
and Journium's AI-driven analytics engine automatically analyzes your event data to generate 
concise, actionable insights.

Think of an Insight Tracker as a continuous data analyst that:
- Monitors specific events in your application
- Analyzes patterns, trends, and anomalies using AI
- Generates natural language insights explaining what's happening and why
- Runs automatically on a schedule or on-demand

## How Insight Trackers Work

Insight Trackers transform raw telemetry data into human-readable insights through an AI-driven pipeline:

1. **Event Collection**: The tracker focuses on specific events you've configured (e.g., `purchase_started`, `user_signup`, `error_occurred`)
2. **Data Analysis**: Journium's AI engine analyzes the event data, looking for patterns, correlations, anomalies, and trends
3. **Insight Generation**: The AI synthesizes findings into concise, natural language insights (typically 1-3 sentences) backed by verifiable data
4. **Delivery**: Insights are displayed in your Journium dashboard on the application instance's 
   insights page [Insights](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/insights)

This process eliminates the need for manual data exploration, SQL queries, or dashboard interpretation. 
The AI does the heavy lifting of data crunching and pattern finding, delivering insights that are both interesting and trustworthy.

You can list an application instance's insight trackers at 
[Developers | Insight Trackers](https://dashboard.journium.app/apps/j_app~/instances/j_app_inst~/developers/insight-trackers)
from your application instance page.
