## What is an Application?

Applications in Journium map directly to user applications where tracking is enabled. 
They have a one-to-one mapping with user apps. A Journium app is not a physical app in 
the traditional sense but a container to hold all configuration and settings related 
to tracking events, configuring insight trackers, and viewing app insights.

## How to Create Apps

<div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">

### Create Application

Go to your [Journium dashboard](https://dashboard.journium.app). 
If you have no apps you will land at the app listing page. 
Click on the **Create application** button, give a name for your application, 
and click **Create application**.

### Done

When you create an app in Journium, it creates a default Development instance. 
This is for quick testing.

## App Instances

An app can have two types of instances: **Development** and **Production**. 
These instances are independent of each other in terms of their configuration. 
The production instance is what you should track for production purposes. 
All features are available in both instances. You can create a production 
instance after you test adequately event generation, trackers, and insights 
in the Development instance.

The instances can be switched in the instance selector in the dashboard. 
The API keys are different for the two instances.

### Development Instance

The Development instance is created by default when you create an app in Journium. 
It has lower usage quotas that are suitable for local testing and development purposes.

### Production Instance

The Production instance is what you should use for tracking in your production 
environment. You can create a production instance after you have adequately tested 
event generation, trackers, and insights in the Development instance.

## Configuration

The configuration of an app is done in the [Journium dashboard](https://dashboard.journium.app). 
You can configure the app by clicking on the app in the dashboard and then clicking 
on the **Configure** tab in the sidebar. You can provide the configuration parameters
directly on the SDK configuration. If not specified, the configuration that you supply in the
dashboard will be used. The configuration in the SDK takes precedence over the configuration in the dashboard.
The following settings are available.


### Event Capture settings

This section allows you to configure the event capture settings for the app.

#### Flush At

Configure the number of events to accumulate before flushing to the Journium API.

#### Flush Interval (ms)

Configure the time interval in milliseconds between automatic flushes to the Journium API.

#### Sampling

Enable or disable the toggle switch to enable sampling for the app. Reduce event volume by sampling a percentage of events.

#### Sampling Rate

If sampling is enabled, configure the sampling rate. The sampling rate must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
