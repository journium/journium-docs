## What is an Event?

An event in Journium is a single piece of telemetry data. Its the primary primitive that 
drives all the analytics and insights. When you use the Journium SDK, you are essentially sending events to Journium.
Some events are auto-captured by the SDK, such as page views, clicks, form submissions, and errors, but you can control
what you send to Journium.

## Event Structure

An event in Journium has the following structure:

```typescript
{
  event: string;
  properties: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

- `event`: The name of the event.
- `properties`: A record of key-value pairs that you can use to add additional context to the event.

## Event Types

There are two main types of events in Journium:

- Custom Events
- Auto-captured Events
