### Custom Events

Custom Events are events that you manually send to Journium. 
You can send any event you want to Journium, and you can add any properties you want to the event.

```tsx title="app/your-path/page.tsx"
import { useTrackEvent } from '@journium/nextjs';

function ProductPage() {
  const trackEvent = useTrackEvent();

  const handlePurchase = () => {
    trackEvent('purchase_started', {
      product_id: 'prod_123',
      page: 'product_detail',
      value: 29.99
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Buy Now</button>;
}
```

### Auto-captured Events

Auto-captured Events are events that are automatically captured by the SDK. They can be enabled 
or disabled by configuring the SDK. See 
[Advanced Configuration](/docs/advanced-configuration) for more details.
